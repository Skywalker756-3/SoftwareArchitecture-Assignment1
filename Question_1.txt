a) What are the important categories of architectural structures, briefly explain each
category with at least one example.



b) What is an architectural pattern? Briefly describe a commonly used architectural pattern.



c) In the Introduction to Software Architecture lectures, we discussed that one of the issues
not considered good practice is having too many inter-module calls between modules.
Why is that? What are two good design principles that an architect should follow to avoid
having a lot of inter-module calls?

As we discussed in the lectures too many intermodule calls increase interelement communication and create high coupling betwen modules, which hurts and have a negative effect on the key quality attributes such as modifiability and reusability.
This makes changes nonelocal, so a small modification in one module may require changes in many other modules, increasing maintenance cost and complexity. to avoid this problem, an architect should follow the principle of low coupling.
Low coupling reduces dependencies between modules so that changes in one module have minimal impact on other modules.
Another important design principle is high cohesion. That ensures that each module has a well defined responsibility, reducing the need for frequent interactions with other modules.
